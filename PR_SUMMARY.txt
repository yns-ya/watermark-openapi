Title: Netlify build hardening + AI Prompt integration on index.html

Summary:
- Netlify build: switch back to frozen installs (pnpm install). Requires a clean, committed pnpm-lock.yaml.
- Previously unblocked Netlify by using --no-frozen-lockfile; now reverting to frozen for deterministic CI.
- Integration UX:
  - Added AI Assistant Prompt section to index.html with a Copy Prompt button.
  - Copy loads full prompt from public/assets/ai_prompt.txt while showing a short hint in the code block.
  - Updated API endpoint on index.html to live Netlify function URL.
  - Removed separate integration.html to keep a single landing/integration page.
- Repo hygiene: kept minimal docs and .netlifyignore to reduce bundle size.

Deployment/Operations Notes:
- Ensure pnpm-lock.yaml is freshly regenerated and committed before deploying:
  1) pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
  2) git add pnpm-lock.yaml
  3) git commit -m "Fix: regenerate pnpm-lock.yaml"
  4) git push
- Then Netlify frozen installs will succeed with the updated lockfile.

Files changed:
- netlify.toml: build.command -> pnpm install (frozen)
- public/index.html: add AI Prompt section + Copy logic, update endpoint to Netlify URL
- public/assets/ai_prompt.txt: added with full prompt content
- .netlifyignore: reduce upload size (retain README.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, SECURITY.md)
- Removed public/integration.html

Test plan:
- Netlify build passes on frozen install with updated pnpm-lock.yaml.
- On index.html:
  - Copy Prompt copies the full AI text from /assets/ai_prompt.txt
  - API endpoint shown is the Netlify function URL

Rollback:
- If needed, set build.command back to "pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile".
- Restore integration.html if you prefer a separate page.
